;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs maintains a set of mark-rings (global and per-buffer) which
;; can be used as a simple "where have I been" log. This library
;; provides a function call list-marks which shows the list of marks
;; and allows a quick navigation to where you were.

;;; Further reading:

;; I've taken some hints from:
